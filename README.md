# Air-Monitoring-System-IoT
- The project's main goal is to measure air quality using the MQ135 sensor in conjunction with DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors.
- Significance: Encouraging awareness and advocating for a healthier future for future generations depend heavily on air quality monitoring.
- Governmental Programs: Because of their high emissions of pollutants, the Indian government has taken action to restrict motorcycles with "single" and "two" stroke engines.
- Implementation: ThinkSpeak Cloud server and other IoT platforms will be used in the project's implementation of a comparable system.
- The intention is to raise people's awareness of the harm that pollution causes to the environment.
- New Delhi is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world, with air quality frequently reaching 300 parts per million.
- Visualization: To raise public awareness of air quality, the project uses bar graphs and serial monitors to display information on ThinkSpeak's home screen.
