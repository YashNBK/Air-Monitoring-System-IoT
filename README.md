# Air-Monitoring-System-IoT
This project deals with measuring Air Quality using MQ135 sensor along with
Temperature & Humidity DHT11 sensor. Measuring Air Quality is an important element for
bringing lot of awareness in the people to take care of the future generations a healthier life.
Based on this, Government of India has already taken certain measures to ban 'Single Stroke' and
'Two Stroke' Engine based motorcycles which are emitting high pollutions comparatively. We
are trying to implement the same system using IoT application platforms like Think Speak Cloud server, we can
bring awareness to every individual about the harm we are doing to our environment. Already,
New Delhi is remarked as the most pollution city in the world recording Air Quality above
300PPM. We set the Bar Graph as well as serial display monitor on home screen of Think Speak to public such
that everyone can come to know the Air Quality at the location where the Sensors is installed.
